              <h3>
                Why NOT curate an exclusive network of uber-talented techies and
                developers for companies in need?

            </div>
            <span>Nice story… </span>
            <span>but here’s what really happened.</span>
            <p>
              In the wee hours one cold winter night, Joshua’s annoyance level
              finally hit the roof. He was DONE getting catfished by recruiters
              who kept pawning off candidates that were all talk and no walk
              (and no C++).
            </p>

            <h2>The tech-recruitment system had to change.</h2>
            <p>
              If no one else would do it, he would do it himself. With his
              equally frustrated, equally motivated tech buddies, of course.
            </p>
            <p>
              Putting their heads together, these hustlers came up with some
              ground rules for a company that would fix tech hiring for real.
            </p>
            <p>
              And from then on, every tech founder lived happily ever after. (At
              least the ones who found Talentcrowd)
